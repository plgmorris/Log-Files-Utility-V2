# Log-Files-Utility-V2

First of all you select a folder where log files are located.

Running backup then moves files that contain a search string in their name into a seperate folder. The folder will contain the Date.

Now you can zip up these backed up log files, or after stopping the backup, you can delete the backed up files. 
This will delete the seperate folder to remove the back up files.

The last section allows you to search all log files in the chosen folder for a string. It will show all files that contain that string
and also include the line number for each occurance.

You can then open that file in the default program for that file,
or if notepad++ is installed it will open in that on the selected line number
